# Mobile Robot Navigation in Unstructured Terrains 
This repo contains three main utilities:
- Random generation of unstructured environments using the OpenSimplex algorithm
- Geometric traversability analysis for wheel robots
- A* on a lattice space path planning algorithm

## 1. Natural terrain generation with OpenSimplex
The Opensimplex Python API is used along with three filtering techniques to render realistic terrains.
